commons-coverage
================

A map for Wikimedia Commons coverage http://tools.wmflabs.org/commons-coverage/ I would like a Wikimedia Commons with one image per km2 at least.

It is inspired by [Geograph Britain and Ireland](http://www.geograph.org.uk).

Commons-coverage uses [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) and [leaflet-maskcanvas](https://github.com/domoritz/leaflet-maskcanvas).
